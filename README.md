CCG Lite
=======

A lightweight replacement for [Custom Combat Gaming's Arma2 mod launcher](http://customcombatgaming.com/forums/index.php?/forum/48-ccg-launcher/)  
CCG's Arma2 launcher doesn't work so well for me, often not returning online status or player counts  

Also, just generally don't like the design. Sorry guys.  
Someday I might manage downloading mods with this, but [DayZ Commander](http://www.dayzcommander.com/) has it down pat  

My C# knowledge is slightly more than by ability to Google. Please excuse the mess contained in this repo

Uses the following libraries:
